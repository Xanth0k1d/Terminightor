## Description
Terminightor is a simple alarm clock for Android with a spicy special. In order to put off an alarm, you have to hold a NFC tag onto your phone. Unless you do that the alarm will not stop, even if you try to kill the Terminightor service.

So if you put a tag for example into your bathroom, and set up an alarm with that tag, it will ensure that you really get up in the morning.

## Features:
* repeat/don't repeat alarms
* repeat alarms only on certain week days
* custom ring-tone
* put vibration on/off
* put alarms off via NFC tag

*This is a branch of the original app.*
I really like this project, and seeing that the latest release is over 3 years old (as of end of 2020), I'm hoping to improve this project, here are some of the things that I'm planning to do:
1. Auto save the alarms (as of now you have to return to the main page for the alarm to be saved after changing the time or settings)
